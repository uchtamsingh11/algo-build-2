# Test Coverage for Next.js Authentication App

This document outlines the test coverage for the Next.js authentication application components.

## Components Tested

### Authentication Pages

1. **Signup Page** (`app/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Suspense boundary implementation
   - ✅ Error handling via search params
   - ✅ Notification display
   - ✅ Proper import and usage of `SignUpForm` from correct path

2. **Login Page** (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Suspense boundary implementation
   - ✅ Success notification after signup
   - ✅ Proper import and usage of `LoginForm`

3. **Error Page** (`app/auth/error/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Suspense boundary implementation
   - ✅ Error handling with specific error messages
   - ✅ Default error handling when no specific error provided
   - ✅ Error code display

### UI Components

1. **AnimatedGroup** (`components/ui/animated-group.tsx`)
   - ✅ Default animation (fade)
   - ✅ Custom animation presets (slide, scale, blur, zoom)
   - ✅ Sequential animation delays
   - ✅ Custom class application
   - ✅ Support for all animation presets

## CSS Animations

The global CSS file (`app/globals.css`) includes animation keyframes that are used by the `AnimatedGroup` component:
- fadeIn
- slideInRight
- slideIn
- scaleIn
- blurIn
- zoomIn

These animations are tested indirectly through the `AnimatedGroup` component tests.

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: Component rendering and interaction testing
- **jest-dom**: Additional DOM assertions

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Coverage Thresholds

The project is configured with the following coverage thresholds:
- Branches: 80%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%
- Statements: 80%

## Areas for Improvement

Future test enhancements could include:
1. Integration tests for form submissions
2. End-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress
3. Testing for proper handling of authentication state
4. Performance testing for animations
